# PrototypeRazorApp
I believe all you have to do to run this is to use this tutorial here "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/model?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio" and recreate the database I used by scaffolding everything and migrating. Then you have to delete the duplicate views and it should work?
